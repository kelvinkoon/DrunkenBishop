## Drunken Bishop Algorithm CLI

The [Drunken Bishop Algorithm](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/59670/the-drunken-bishop) was developed by Alexander von Gernler to create an ASCII representation given a string of hexidecimal digits known as a fingerprint. Most notably, OpenSSH uses this method to make it easier to differentiate fingerprints visually.
